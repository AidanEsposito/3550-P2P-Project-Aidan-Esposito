Books with P2P Network:

This project allows a user to interact with others and share their favorite books with a description and review

Usage:

* ls b: lists out all books currently over all of the p2p network

* ls b all: lists all books given by all peers

* ls b {peerId}: lists all books given by a specific peer id

* create b: creates a new book with a possible title, description, and review

* publish b: publishes the current book created in create b for everyone to see

* ls p: list all current peers over the p2p network

Project Proposal: 

For my Peer to Peer network project I would like to develop a program that allows users to store a virtual catalog of book titles and descriptions.
